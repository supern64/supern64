## Hello!
I'm SuperN64. I code mainly in Python, Javascript and Java.  
I also sometimes code in other languages, but I'm used to the 3 the most.  
I like to do stupid stuff nobody ever does.  
I mainly do websites, APIs, Discord bots and the like.  
Thanks for reading... whatever the hell this is.

```python
print("Hello world!")
```
```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
