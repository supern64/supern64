## Hello! o/
I'm SuperN64. I code mainly in Python, Typescript/Javascript and Java.  
I'm looking into learning C# and Rust, maybe get into hell with VB6.  
I mainly make websites, APIs, Discord bots, useless software and the like.  
Thanks for reading! *(you didn't have to)*

```python
print("Hello world!")
```
```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
```
